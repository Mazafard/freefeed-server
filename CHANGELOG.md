# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
 - The output of `GET /v2/server-info` has a new field
   _externalAuthProvidersInfo_ that contains an id, brand and title of each
   available external identity provider, so the client can show the proper
   buttons even if it doesn't know about these providers. The type of this field
   is `{ id: string, brand: string, title: string }[]`. The
   _externalAuthProviders_ field still present for compatibility with the old
   clients and contains only id's of these providers.

### Changed
 - The format of _externalAuthProviders_ configuration key was changed, see the
   [separate document](config/external-auth-providers.md) for the details. The
   site administrator can now configure almost any OAuth2 external identity
   provider. There are three predefined templates for Google, Facebook, and
   GitHub.

 - The new fields in the config: _siteTitle_, _company.title_ and
   _company.address_. These fields can be used to customize site (FreeFeed
   instance) branding in emails, RSS feeds and service messages.

## [1.87.0] - 2020-10-13
### Added
 - The Server-Timing response header (for now, it contains a single metric,
   'total' - the total request processing time)

### Fixed
 - In the real-time message about the groups' update, the listener's
   subscription to the groups additionally checked. Without this check, the user
   could see groups he isn't subscribed to in the recent groups' list.

## [1.86.0] - 2020-09-15

### Added
- Improve search: search by exact word form, by prefix and with word order
  operator

## [1.85.0] - 2020-09-01

### Fixed

- Groups in realtime events (such as `user:update` or `global:user:update`) now
  serializes according to the current user. This affects the visibility of the
  group's administrators list.
- Respect privacy-settings given during account creation

### Changed
- The main homefeed hide list is now applied to posts authored by friends (in
  _friends-all-activity_ mode). It affects the following situation: you are
  subscribed to the user U in main homefeed and to the group G in secondary
  homefeed, and U created a post in G. Now you will not see this post in main
  homefeed in _friends-all-activity_ mode.
